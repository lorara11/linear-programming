# Linear programming using GNU MathProg

This repository contains my solutions to the problems proposed at the Computer Labs on linear programming, done as part of the module on Discrete Mathematics for the Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. The language used is GNU MathProg.

### Execution

The code can be interpreted using `glpsol`, the GLPK command-line solver, running the following command:

``` glpsol -m ex.mod -o ex.sol ```

where ``ex.mod`` is the file to be interpreted.
